<h1>10 FAQs about national parks.</h1>
    <dl>
    <dt>What is a National Park?</dt>
    <dd class = "invisible" id ='val'>National Parks are substantial tracts of land, sometimes remote, with wide open spaces large enough to provide the public with opportunities for outdoor recreation. National Parks are designated because of their landscape quaility, wildlife and their values as a recreational resource.</dd>
    <dt>Why were the National Parks created?</dt>
    <dd class = "invisible">
        The statutory purposes of National Parks are:

        To conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Parks
        To promote opportunities for the public understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the Parks
        In those cases where conflict exists between the two purposes and reconciliation proves impossible, the first purpose should take precedence. This is known as the Sandford Principle.

        The Broads was designated under a special Act of Parliament and is a member of the National Park family. Its three statutory purposes are conserving and enhancing the natural beauty of the Broads, promoting the enjoyment of the Broads by the public and protecting the interests of navigation.
    </dd>
    <dt>Why is it important to protect National Parks?</dt>
    <dd class = "invisible">
        National Parks are important and special areas covering 10% of the land area in England and Wales.  They protect vital landscapes and wildlife habitats, are important places where people live and work, and provide a focus for recreation and tourism for millions of visitors each year.
    </dd>
    <dt>How are National Parks managed?</dt>
    <dd class = "invisible">National Park Authorities (NPAs) are the bodies charged with the achievement of National Park purposes. They are members of the local government family as well as being independent, special purpose authorities established to act in the best interests of the National Parks and to encourage others to do the same. The NPAs and the Broads Authority are funded by Defra and the Welsh Assembly Government.</dd>
    <dt>Who owns the land in National Parks?</dt>
    <dd class = "invisible">Although some land within the Parks is managed by the National Park Authority, National Park status does not automatically signify national ownership of the land as in other countries such as the USA. Within a National Park the majority of land is owned by farmers and other private landowners including conservation organisations such as the National Trust.</dd>
    <dt>Know when to go!</dt>
    <dd class = "invisible">“If you are a parent like me with kids in grade school you need to plan your trips around when they are free, which will be in the summer during peak tourist season,” he says. “There are crowds at popular spots, but you can go at unusual times. Go early in the morning or late at night with a full moon. Everything is quieter and you can feel almost as if you are alone.”</dd>
    <dt>Go with a mission in mind!</dt>
    <dd class = "invisible"> When planning a trip to a sprawling national park, especially one as vast as Yellowstone, it can be overwhelming deciding where to start. Instead of fretting over how many historic landmarks you need to fit into your trip itinerary and driving yourself crazy with time allotments and schedules, pick one thing you want to accomplish on your trip.</dd>
    <dt>Travel light!</dt>
    <dd class = "invisible">There is nothing worse than packing too much. When you are traveling to a national park, less is more.

    </dd>
    <dt>Bring the best gear!</dt>
    <dd class = "invisible">It’s not just how much you pack that’s important, but also what you bring with you.</dd>
    <dt>Stay at a national park lodge!</dt>
    <dd class = "invisible">Book early to stay at a park lodge; many fill up quickly. If you’re trying for a lodge that’s already full, check back every day for cancellations.  </dd>
