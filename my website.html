    <h1>My story</h1>
    <p class="text-muted">Growing up in my hometown of Brenham, Texas, I had dreams of becoming a professional basketball player—something that didn’t work out most likely due to my lack of height. But when I got to high school, I found an interest in technology and mathematics. This led me to choose Computer Science as my major when I enrolled at the University of Houston in 2012. However, after one semester I switched my major to Economics because I wanted a degree that could lead me on to a variety of career paths. After two years I transferred to the University of Texas at San Antonio, finished my degree in Economics, and began my Master’s of Education degree with a concentration in Instructional Technology one year later. My first class of my graduate degree reintroduced me to HTML, CSS, and Javascript and made me realize how much I enjoy building websites. The numerous challenges that exist in the process of coding a website are what drive my passion. My work ethic of problem solving and determination push me to create products that exhibit my best work while my diverse educational background allows me to contribute a skillset in web design that companies and/or agencies might not find from other candidates. Codeup has refined these skills and led me toward discovering a career path that encompasses all my interests.
